## The Progamming Farmer's Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Tammy, and I'm a student in the University of Washington's programming bootcamp. This is a portfolio of my work!

## About the Layout
While I've customized it for my purposes, it is based largely on Drew Ryan's W3 Newbie Bootstrap 4 tutorial. Check out his work here: [https://www.facebook.com/w3newbie/](https://www.facebook.com/w3newbie/)
